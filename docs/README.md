1. Initialize Loginservice in your application, with a few lines of code.

    ```javascript
    import Loginservice from '@tooltwist/loginservice'

    Vue.use(Loginservice, options)
    ```

    >
    > import Loginservice from '@tooltwist/loginservice'
    >
    > Vue.use(Loginservice, options)

1. Place the login component on your page.

    ```html
    <loginservice-login/>
    ```

    > &lt;loginservice-login/&gt;

Other functionality is adding by similarly enabling features on the dashboard and using Vue components on your pages.
